<h2>Why this was created?</h2>
<p>I pretty much like the conception of NGL App or Tellonym, but I didn't like overall application operation. So, I created my own alternative to them with some added features and no analytics inside source code.</p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- Receiving anonymous questions from people that have sent a message on main page with notifications (by using Telegram Bot API Integration)
- Replying to anonymous questions with use of Markdown formatting system that not only can **format** ~~text~~ but also embed an YouTube video or OpenStreetMap geolocation
- Show/Hide all questions with a single click
- Manually show/hide single question
- Multiple Sender Blocking based on sender's IP address blacklisting in one of the database tables (IP Addresses of Users around the internet are public after all, so sender's anonymity/privacy has not been lost!)
- Protected Administrator REST API
- Public User REST API
- Secure authorization/authentication system
- SQL Injection / XSS / CSRF Protection
- Completely refreshed User Interface
- Integrated Backend Tools for recovering/changing administrator password, deleting administrator account or for restoring factory default application settings
- Rate-limiting to prevent abusive actions
- Application update alerts
